This is the test application written by Andrew Wright for Agora Games

A work version of it can be found at http://lobachevsky.net/rails/ which is running on Apache using the Passenger software to support Rails.  This project represents my first exposure to and use of Passenger, Ruby and Rails.

The project requirements weren't too specific about certain details so I took a little leeway in using Ajax to make it a single page affair, along with replacing prototype with jQuery (making sure to install the Rails driver).

NOTE: config/database.yml has been exluded from the respository
